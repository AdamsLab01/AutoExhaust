Automatic Exhaust

This sketch was written to in order to automate the exhausting of a small "server" room in my house. The idea is to
exhaust the hot server rom air outside, or inside (to another part) of the house depending on if the central furnace 
is on or not. If the server room is too hot and needs to be exhausted and the central house heater is on then the system 
will open the indoor damer (and close the outdoor one) to exhaust the hot server room air into the main part of the house, 
to help heat it. If the central house heater is off then the hot server room air will be exhausted outside.
